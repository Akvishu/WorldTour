<p> The Napoleon is a five-star hotel in Paris. It is located in the immediate vicinity of the Arc de Triomphe, at number 40 Avenue Friedland, in the 8th arrondissement. In 1923 the Martinez group commissioned the architect Henri Porteau, to build a luxury home in the place of the old private residence of Count Tolstoi. Later on, the residence changed hands and was acquired by the Rothschild family. The Napoleon Bonaparte was opened in 1928 as a "hotel de charme" (small distinctive hotel or boutique hotel). Literary figures of the time frequented the hotel regularly. In 1929 the hôtel de charme became a hotel de luxe (luxury hotel) and reached the grade of "petit palace". It was then named Napoléon Paris as a reference to its location right by the Arc de Triomphe. In March 2013, the French Agency of Tourist Development classified the hotel as a 5 star hotel. The Napoléon Paris is the only hotel completely decorated with Napoleonic art, and furnished in the Directoire style. The hotel combines tradition and modernity, without forgetting a decidedly personal touch. </p>
