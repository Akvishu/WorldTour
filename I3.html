<h2> GOA, BEACHES AND SUNSETS </h2>
<P> <img src=I3.jpeg> 
		Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese colony 
		prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the area’s tropical spice plantations. Goa is also known 
		for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.
		Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the region known as the Konkan, and geographically separated 
		from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats.It is surrounded by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and 
		Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea forming its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and the 
		fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states, two and a half times that of 
		the country. It was ranked the best-placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked 
		on top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators.
		Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city.
