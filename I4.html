<h2> SHIMLA </h2>

<img src=I4.gif>
		Shimla is the capital of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, in the Himalayan foothills. Once the summer 
		capital of British India, it remains the terminus of the narrow-gauge Kalka-Shimla Railway, completed in 1903. It’s also 
		known for the handicraft shops that line The Mall, a pedestrian avenue, as well as the Lakkar Bazaar, a market specializing 
		in wooden toys and crafts. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later made the capital of 
		Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state. As the summer capital, 
		Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. 
		After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. 
		Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After 
		reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Shimla is home to a number of 
		buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple 
		temples and churches.
