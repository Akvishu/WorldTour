		The Andaman & Nicobar islands is a union territory of India comprising 572 islands of which 37 are inhabited are a group of 
		islands at the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. The territory is about 150 km north of Aceh in Indonesia and separated
		from Thailand and Myanmar by the Andaman Sea. It comprises two island groups, the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar
		Islands. The Andaman Sea lies to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west. The territory's capital is the city of *Port Blair*.
		In 1858, the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent. The primary purpose was
		to set up a penal colony for criminal convicts from the Indian subcontinent. The colony came to include the infamous
		Cellular Jail. In 1872, the Andaman &Nicobar Islands were united under a single chief commissioner at Port Blair.
