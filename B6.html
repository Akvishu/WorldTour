You can drive to Ibirapuera Park in just 5 minutes from the Emiliano. Congonhas Airport is a 20-minute drive away. This is our guests' favourite part of Sao Paulo, according to independent reviews. Couples particularly like the location — they rated it 9.7 for a two-person trip. The hotel is amazing and the brunch is something I’m looking forward to try it again very soon
The location is great tou can find literally everything that you need.
