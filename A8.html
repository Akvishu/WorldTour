<p> Grand America Hotels & Resorts (formerly known as Little America) is a chain of eight hotels and resorts in the Western United States. Little America is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 68 at the 2010 census. The community got its name from the Little America motel, which was purposefully located in a remote location as a haven, not unlike the base camp the polar explorer Richard E. Byrd set up in the Antarctic in 1928. However, being situated on a coast-to-coast highway and offering travel services, it thrived, launching a chain of travel facilities by the same name. Its developer, Robert Earl Holding, died on April 19, 2013, with a personal net worth of over $3 billion. As of the census of 2000, there were 56 people, 24 households, and 13 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 7.2 people per square mile (2.8/km2). There were 48 housing units at an average density of 6.2/sq mi (2.4/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 71.43% White, 28.57% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 44.64% of the population. </p>
