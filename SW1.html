<P> Zurich lies on the picturesque shores of Lake Zurich as well as at the base of the Alps, ensuring that wherever you look, you are sure to find beautiful vistas and stunning scenery. Popular activities in Zurich include boating on the lake, or simply strolling along its pristine edges, or you can go for a light hike at Utliberg Mountain. Not just a one hit wonder, Zurich is also a city of culture and there are a plethora of museums to visit such as the Swiss National Museum housed within an alpine style castle. If you are an art lover then this city doesn’t disappoint with over 100 galleries to choose from, or if you prefer shopping then you can make for one or several of the high end boutiques that Zurich is known for and indulge in some retail therapy of famous Swiss brands.
