	<LI> Sao Paulo International Airport</LI>
<p> <img src=B11.jpg> Sao Paulo, often referred to as GRU Airport, or simply GRU, is the primary international airport serving Sao Paulo. It is popularly known locally as either Cumbica Airport, after the district where it is located and the Brazilian Air Force base that still exists at the airport complex, or Guarulhos Airport, after the municipality of Guarulhos, in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, where it is located. Since November 28, 2001 the airport has been named after Andre Franco Montoro (1916–1999), former Governor of São Paulo state. The airport was rebranded as GRU Airport in 2012. In Brazil the airport was ranked first in terms of transported passengers, aircraft operations, and cargo handled in 2012, placing it as the second busiest airport in Latin America by passenger traffic (36,596,326 in 2016) after Mexico City International Airport.

	<LI> Brasilia International Airport</LI>
<p> <img src=B12.png> Brasilia– is the only international airport serving Brasilia. The airport was named after Juscelino Kubitschek (1902–1976), the 21st President of Brazil. It is located in the administrative region of Lago Sul, in the Federal District. Some of its facilities are shared with the Brazilian Air Force. It is operated by Inframerica. Brasília was only a project when in 1956 President Juscelino Kubitschek landed for the first time in the Central Plateau. Vera Cruz Airport,built in 1955 by the then Deputy-Governor of Goiás, Bernardo Sayão, at the request of the chairman of the location of the New Federal Capital, Marechal José Pessoa, already existed. On 2 October 1955, the airport received the first crew of workers that would build the new capital. This facility was located where today is the Integrated Bus and Train Terminal of Brasília. It had a dirt runway of 2,700 metres.

	<LI>Tancredo Neves International Airport</LI>
<p> <img src=b13.jpg> Tancredo Neves, formerly called Confins International Airport is the primary international airport serving Belo Horizonte. Since 2 September 1986 the airport is named after Tancredo de Almeida Neves (1910–1985), President-elect of Brazil. It is located in the municipality of Confins, in the Minas Gerais. It is operated by BH Airport S.A. The airport was built by Infraero and inaugurated in 1984. Its purpose was to lessen the congestion at Pampulha Airport, which at the time was operating at 120% of its capacity of 1.3 million passengers per year. It was expected that by 1990, passenger movement at Confins would be nearly 2 million passengers per year. However, it surpassed the 1 million passenger mark only 22 years later. Presently its maximum operational capacity is 22 million passengers per year. Its cargo facilities have a capacity of handling 18.000 tones.

	<LI> Recife International Airport</LI>
<p> <img src=B14.jpg> Recife International Airport is the airport serving Recife, Brazil. It is operated by AENA. Some of its facilities are shared with the Recife Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force. Originally called Ibura Airport, the airport had its name changed to Guararapes Airport in 1948. The facility originated at the time of World War II, when a new airport was built to replace the earlier airfield, Parque do Encanta Moça. With the end of the War, the facility became strategically important as a technical and refueling stop on the route from South America to Europe. On 18 January 1958, a new passenger terminal was inaugurated, replacing the original facility. In 1979, an agreement with Infraero was made in order to further develop the airport complex. The passenger terminal underwent its first major renovation in 1982 and another enlargement in 1990.

	<LI> Viracopos International Airport</LI>
<p> <img src=B15.jpg> Viracopos/Campinas International Airport is an international airport serving the municipality of Campinas, in the Sao Paulo State. On 6 January 1987, the airport name was officially normalized to its present form. It is named after the neighborhood where it is located. Viracopos's origin can be traced to a simple airfield near Campinas built during the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution in Sao Paulo. In 1960 it was improved with a 3,240 m runway, long enough to accommodate the first generation of intercontinental jet planes such as the Boeing 707, de Havilland Comet, Vickers VC10, Convair 990, and Douglas DC-8, and received its first international flight. Furthermore, Viracopos served as an alternate airport for Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport and São Paulo airports particularly because it rarely closes due to bad weather conditions. Soon airlines such as Varig, VASP and Real established services to Viracopos.
