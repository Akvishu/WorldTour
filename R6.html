Lotte Hotel St. Petersburg is located in a historical mansion adjacent to the Mariinsky Palace on St. Isaac's Square. Having once been home to the first ambassador to the Russian Empire, the sixth president (John Quincy Adams), and the Russian writer Nikolay Gogol, Lotte Hotel St. Petersburg is the first Lotte Hotel ever to be housed in a historical building. Named Russia's Leading Hotel in 2018 and Europe's Leading New Hotel in 2017 by the World Travel Awards, the Lotte Hotel St. Petersburg features rooms decorated in classic and contemporary styles. The restaurant facilities include The Lounge, an all-day dining restaurant with a grandiose stained glass cupola; MEGUmi, the first premium Japanese restaurant in St. Petersburg; and L Terrasa, a rooftop bar with a spectacular view over St. Isaac's Square. The world famous authentic Balinese Mandara Spa is committed to providing guests with the highest level spa experience.
