<h1> Ponta Dos Ganchos Resort </h1> 
<img src=B7.jpg> 
<p> Located on a private peninsula near Florianopolis on Brazil's south coast, Ponta dos Ganchos is one of the country's most exclusive beach resorts. A ridge of Atlantic rainforest runs down to the water, where three tiny islands horseshoe around a sandy bay. A thatched restaurant idles ten feet from the beach, but paddle across to one of the islands and you find a bar that’s illuminated by torches at night. You are in the middle of nowhere here, and Ponta dos Ganchos delivers the dream: idyllic landscapes of emerald sea and forest, contemporary interiors in 20 beautiful bngalows (some with private plunge pools, saunas and jacuzzis) and service that’s second to none (all meals, including breakfast, are served at any hour of the day). Follow the coast round on either side and you come to tiny fishing villages, but most stay put and bask in luxury. There’s an indoor pool, tennis and volleyball, even a private cinema. Snorkelling, diving (including tuition), canoeing, sailing and boat trips are also on offer.
