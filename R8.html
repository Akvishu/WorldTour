Barvikha Hotel & Spa is located just a short drive from the Kremlin and five miles away from the Moscow ring road, which you can reach by driving through a lush pine forest. Once in Moscow head to the Bolshoi for ballet or opera or to the Maly Theater for drama, or fast-forward through Russian history by visiting the Kremlin Museum. With interiors by Italian Industrial Designer Antonio Citterio, furniture by B&B, a lobby decked out in sultry natural stone and airport transfers in Bentleys, Bavikha Hotel and Spa certainly delivers on the bling front. Each of the 65 rooms and suites comes equipped with an underfloor heated terrace, Bang & Olufson HD screens and beds clad in Frette linens. Some bathrooms feature steam showers and their own massage table, if yours doesn’t head spa wards for the 17 treatment rooms, hammam, sauna and pools. Dining-wise Head Chef Anatoly Komm wows guests with his twist on traditional Russian cuisine.
