<img src="A6.jpg" >
<p> Nantucket is an island and town 30 mi (48 km) off the coast of Cape Cod and part of Massachusetts. The island offers quiet harbors, dramatic cliffs, sandy beaches, lighthouses, beautiful old mansions and gardens, interesting history even a series of (sometimes bawdy) limericks about its residents. Whether you are looking for a few nights out on the town with friends, a fun-filled weekend with the kids, or a little Nantucket is where you want to be. 
The local government and people of Nantucket are environmentally friendly and green conscious. There is a wonderful recycling system intact that must be followed by all visitors and residents of the island. About 36% of the island is protected and maintained by the Nantucket Conservation Foundation. Protected lands include beaches, hardwood forests, dunes, shrublands, bogs, heathlands, marshes, grasslands, meadows, and ponds. The Nantucket Conservation Foundation also works to preserve the local wildlife of the island. To see the local sea life of the Island there is an aquarium, which is open to the public for a small admission fee. Whale, seal and bird watching are three very popular past times that many locals, vacationers and their families enjoy taking part in. </p>
