<p> 		Taj Hotels is a chain of luxury hotels and a subsidiary of the Indian Hotels Company Limited; headquartered at Express 
		Towers, Nariman Point in Mumbai. Incorporated by the founder of the Tata Group, Jamsetji Tata, in 1903, the company is a 
		part of the Tata Group, one of India's largest business conglomerates. The company employed over 13,000 people in the year
		2010. Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the Tata Group, opened the Taj Mahal Palace, a hotel in Mumbai (formerly called 
		Bombay) overlooking the Arabian Sea, on 16 December 1903. It was the first Taj property and the first Taj hotel. There are 
		several anecdotal stories about why Tata opened the Taj hotel. According to a story, he decided to open the hotel after an 
		incident involving racial discrimination at the Watson's Hotel in Mumbai, where he was refused entry as the hotel permitted 
		only Europeans. In 1974, the group opened India's first international five-star deluxe beach resort, the Fort Aguada Beach Resort
		in Goa. In 1970s, the Taj Group also began its business in metropolitan hotels, opening the five-star deluxe hotel, Taj Coromandel in
		Chennai, in 1974, and also opening the Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi in 1978.
