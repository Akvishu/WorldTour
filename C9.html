<h2> FAIRMONT PACIFIC RIM </h2>
<img src=C9.jpg>
<p> Fairmont Pacific Rim is an upscale hotel and condominium building in Vancouver, British Columbia. It stands at 140 m or 44 stories tall and was 
completed just prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 4, 2010. The skyscraper, which is part of the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts chain, is located 
at 1038 Canada Place in Downtown Vancouver in the Coal Harbor neighborhood by the Burrard Inlet waterfront. Right beside the Shaw Tower, it is also 
attached to the West Building of the Vancouver Convention & Exhibition Centre. The Southern and Eastern exteriors are wrapped with an art installation 
of a Liam Gillick poem. Fairmont Pacific Rim was developed by Westbank Corp. and the Peterson Group with architecture by James KM Cheng Architects 
Inc. This is the fourth Fairmont Hotel in the Vancouver Metropolitan Area. The hotel occupies the first 22 floors of the 44 storey building, with the remaining
floors being condominiums. There are a total of 175 residential condominium units beginning from the 23rd floor. The entrance for the residential units is 
located at 1011 Cordova Street W. The condominiums were sold at a price of $2,100 per square foot, one of the highest in Canada at the time.  </p>
