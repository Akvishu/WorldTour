<p> Banff is a town within Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. It is located in Alberta's Rockies along the Trans-Canada Highway, approximately 
126 km (78 mi) west of Calgary and 58 km (36 mi) east of Lake Louise. At 1,400 to 1,630 m (4,590 to 5,350 ft) above sea level, Banff is the community with 
the second highest elevation in Alberta, after Lake Louise. The Town of Banff was the first municipality to incorporate within a Canadian national park. 
The town is a member of the Calgary Regional Partnership. Banff is a resort town and one of Canada's most popular tourist destinations. Known for its 
mountainous surroundings and hot springs, it is a destination for outdoor sports and features extensive hiking, biking, scrambling and skiing destinations
within the area. Sunshine Village, Ski Norquay and Lake Louise Ski Resort are the three nearby ski resorts located within the national park. Banff was 
first settled in the 1880s, after the transcontinental railway was built through the Bow Valley. In 1883, three Canadian Pacific Railway workers stumbled 
upon a series of natural hot springs on the side of Sulphur Mountain.
