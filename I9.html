		The Oberoi Group is a hotel group with its head office in Delhi. Founded in 1934, the company owns and/or operates 31 
		luxury hotels and two river cruise ships in six countries, primarily under its Oberoi Hotels & Resorts and Trident Hotels brands.
		The two major holding companies of The Oberoi Group are EIH Ltd and EIH Associated Hotels (formerly East India Hotels). 
		P.R.S. Oberoi is the current chairman of The Oberoi Group. His son, Vikram Singh Oberoi, and Suresh Oberoi serve in the 
		capacities of the Joint Managing Directors at the holding companies. The company currently manages 31 hotels under the 
		luxury brand Oberoi Hotels & Resorts, with a further 10 five-star properties under the Trident Hotels brand. The foundations of the 			Oberoi Group date back to 1934 when Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi, the founder of the group, bought two properties: the Maidens in 		Delhi and the Clarke's in Shimla. In the following years Oberoi, assisted by his two sons, Tilak Raj Singh Oberoi and Prithvi Raj Singh 			Oberoi (P.R.S. Oberoi), continued the expansion of their group with properties both in India and abroad. </P>
