<h1> Ramada Plaza Hotel </h1>

<p> Ramada is a large UA multinational hotel chain owned by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. As of December 31, 2018, they operate 811 hotels with 114,614 rooms across 63 countries under the Ramada brand. Ramada opened its first hotel,a 60-room facility, on U.S. Route 66 at Flagstaff, Arizona in 1954 and set up its headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, where the chain built the Sahara Hotel on North 1st Street downtown in 1956 (which later became the Ramada Inn Downtown) and a 300-room Ramada Inn in the 3800 block of East Van Buren in 1958 that would become the chain's flagship property and headquarters. Through its early years until the early 1970s, a typical Ramada Inn was built of colonial-Williamsburg-style architecture to set it apart from the standardized architectural designs used by competitors such as Holiday Inn and Howard Johnson's. These are properties that have distinctive triple pillars and a white overhang in the front of the hotel, in addition to all-brick architecture. Most of these are now rebranded under various other names, but a few original Ramada Inns of that colonial design continue as franchises of the chain today.
