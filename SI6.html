Experience life like a local at Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong. Housed on the site of the former Joo Chiat Police Station that is now a conservation building, our hotel features a unique modern design inspired by the Peranakan culture, paying homage to the heritage of its lively neighborhood. 
Unwind with a dip in the rooftop infinity pool overlooking the whole of Singapore's first heritage town as the sun sets slowly behind the Katong skyline. Amenities such as complimentary Wi-Fi, 24-hour fitness center, weekly rooftop yoga classes and function room offer convenience for leisure and business travelers alike. Our all-day neighborhood café and restaurant, Baba Chews, features the best of modern-Singaporean, local favorites, and Western classic dishes alongside specialty coffee/tea and alcoholic beverages. Malls and East Coast Park are within walking distance from the hotel whilst Jewel Changi and Changi Airport, Singapore Expo, Changi Business Park and Singapore's financial district are only 15 minutes away by car.
