<img src=B9.jpg>
<p> The seventh hotel development is the first located in a historic building listed by the Institute of Cultural and Artistic Heritage (IPAC) as Cultural Heritage of Bahia and operates in the magnificent building that housed the first headquarters of the newspaper A Tarde for 45 years. Located in the Castro Alves Square, in the historical center of Salvador, the hotel opened its doors in December 2018.  In a grand former newspaper headquarters dating from 1912, this upmarket hotel within the city center is 11 minutes' walk from the Bay of All Saints and 13 minutes' walk from a metro station. Barra Lighthouse is 5 km away. Featuring wood floors, marble bathrooms and high-thread-count sheets, the polished rooms provide free Wi-Fi, flat-screen TVs and minibars. Some upgraded rooms add bay views, as do suites with living areas. There's a refined Italian restaurant and a bar. A rooftop outdoor pool and a sundeck offer views of the bay. Other amenities consist of a spa, a sauna and a gym. Breakfast is available for a fee. The apartment 106 is the former room of the presidency of the newspaper A Tarde, and has preserved the original parquet floor and Jacarandá panels, as well as the plaster decorations that have been restored.
