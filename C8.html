<h2> BROADVIEW HOTEL </h2>
<img src=C8.jpg>
<p>  The Broadview Hotel is a 58 room boutique hotel in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the intersection of Broadview Avenue and Queen Street 
East in Toronto's Riverside neighbourhood. Built in 1893, the building was originally a hall with retail and office space and later converted into a hotel. 
Until 2014, the establishment was occupied by the New Broadview House Hotel, a hotel and boarding house housing low-income persons with a strip club 
named Jilly's on its ground level. It was closed and converted to an up-scale establishment with several restaurants and a roof patio. The Richardsonian 
Romanesque style structure was built for Archibald Dingman and designed by Robert Ogilvie as a commercial hub and public hall known as Dingman's Hall.
Its design includes arched windows and a tower characteristic of Romanesque Revival. The southeast vertical edge of the building is rounded using curved,
elongated bricks. The building's gray lintels above the windows were likely carved from Credit Valley sandstone, popularly used during Toronto's Victorian 
era. The east and south exterior walls feature 21 terra cotta relief sculptures each with a unique image, often including a human face. The building had the
Canadian Bank of Commerce as a tenant on the ground floor and doctors' and lawyers' offices on the middle floors.  </p>
