<p> Hotel de Vigny is a five-star luxury boutique hotel located in the middle of Paris’ fashionable 8th arrondissement and situated on a quiet street just off the bustling Champs Élysées. It is located a short walk away from Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Arc de Triomphe, Avenue Montaigne and Avenue George V; as well as some of the finest art galleries and museums Paris has to offer. The hotel boasts 26 luxury guestrooms and 11 suites, each individually designed by Nina Campbell. Campbell’s previous projects have included Annabel’s private members club in London, The Salisbury and the Queen of Denmark’s London residence. For Hotel de Vigny, Campbell’s approach has been to combine Parisian charm with old-school British style: an ambience of intimacy and discretion pervades the building. As well as being impeccably stylish, all of the hotels rooms come with state of the art technology, free Wi-Fi and 24 hour Alberico Penati.
