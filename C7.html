<h2> FOUR SEASONS RESORT WHISTLER </h2>
<img src=C7.jpg>
<p>  Four Seasons Hotels Limited, trading as Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, is a Canadian international luxury hospitality company headquartered in 
Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Four Seasons operates more than 100 hotels worldwide. Since 2007, Bill Gates (through Cascade Investment) and Prince Al-
Waleed bin Talal have been majority owners of the company. In 1974, cost overruns at the Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver nearly led the company into 
bankruptcy. As a result, the company began shifting to its current, management-only business model, eliminating costs associated with buying land and 
buildings. The company went public in 1986. In the 1990s, Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton began direct competition, with Ritz-Carlton emphasizing a
uniform look while Four Seasons emphasized local architecture and styles with uniform service; in the end Four Seasons gained market share. Built in 
1986, Four Seasons Hotel Austin is a nine-story hotel on 2.3 acres of land on the Lady Bird Lake's north shore. Economic downturns in the early and mid-
2000s affected the company. When the 11 Sep. attacks caused the collapse of the travel industry, Four Seasons refused to cut room prices in order 
to preserve the perceived value of the brand. </p>
