<p> The Oxford Hotel is a historic building in Denver, Colorado, which was designed by early Denver architect Frank Edbrooke, and built in 1891. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Cruise Room is a hotel bar with historic art deco interior, that was operated as an illicit speakeasy. In February 1908, Bill Haywood and two other officers of the Western Federation of Miners were secretly held overnight in adjacent rooms in the Oxford, by the Denver police. Their stay at the Oxford was kept secret so their supporters could not try to block their extradition early the next morning by a special train to Idaho, to be tried for conspiracy in the assassination of a former governor of Idaho. In the 1950s, the Oxford Hotel was considered a flophouse. In the 1980s a new owner improved the hotel. The hotel restaurant was operated by McCormick's Fish House from when they signed a lease with the Oxford Hotel in 1987 until 2016. Today, Urban Farmer Steakhouse operates as The Oxford Hotel's restaurant partner. </p>
