<p> The Peninsula Paris is a historic luxury hotel, originally known as the Hotel Majestic, located on Avenue Kleber in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, France. It opened in 1908 as the Hotel Majestic and was converted to government offices in 1936. The hotel served as a field hospital for wounded officers during World War I, staffed largely by British aristocrats. During World War II, it served as the headquarters of the German military high command in France during the German occupation of Paris. The building played a pivotal role in the deportation of Parisian Jews and the 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler. The building reopened as The Peninsula Paris in August 2014, following a complicated and costly restoration. Basilewski sold the palace in 1868 to the Duke of Sesto, who renamed it the Palacio Castilla. It was bought on behalf of Queen Isabella II of Spain, who had just been exiled from Spain following the Glorious Revolution. The Duke of Sesto had preceded the queen to France and arranged for her welcome by Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie. The Duke of Sesto and Eugenie had known one another since they were teenagers in Madrid. </p>
