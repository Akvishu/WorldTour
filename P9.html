<p> Hotel Regina is a grand hotel in Paris that was opened in 1900. It is located in the Place des Pyramides, across the Rue de Rivoli from the Jardin des Tuileries and an entrance to the Louvre. In the square in front of the hotel is a gilded statue of Joan of Arc on horseback. Inaugurated in 1900 for the World's Fair in Paris, the hotel is situated on the Place des Pyramides, which takes its name from Napoleon’s victory in Egypt in 1798. The hotel is in a building dating back to the Second Empire. Leonard Tauber and his associate Constant Baverez built it between 1898 and 1900. The Regina was named after Queen Victoria, symbolising the Entente Cordiale between the French and the British. The first phase of renovation to the hotel was completed in summer 2014. The renovations of the second wing, which started in October 2014, were inaugurated on 29 September 2015. The cost estimate for the renovations is 17 million euros. In November 2014, Mr Piazzi was appointed as the new director, and in August 2015, the hotel received its fifth star from the Atout France agency. </p>
