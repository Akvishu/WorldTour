<h2> WHISTLER </h2>
<img src=C5.jpg>
<p> Whistler is a resort municipality in the southern Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in the province of British Columbia, Canada, approximately 
125 km (78 mi) north of Vancouver and 36 km (22 mi) south of the town of Pemberton. Incorporated as the Resort Municipality of Whistler (RMOW), it has 
a permanent population of approximately 11,854, plus a larger but rotating population of seasonal workers, typically younger people from beyond 
British Columbia, notably from United Kingdom, Australia and Europe. Over two million people visit Whistler annually, primarily for alpine skiing and 
snowboarding and, in summer, mountain biking at Whistler Blackcomb. Its pedestrian village has won numerous design awards and Whistler has been 
voted among the top destinations in North America by major ski magazines since the mid-1990s. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Whistler hosted most
of the alpine, Nordic, luge, skeleton, and bobsled events. The Whistler Valley is located around the pass between the headwaters of the Green River and 
the upper-middle reaches of the Cheakamus. </p>
