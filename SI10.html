<h1> Parkroyal Hotel </h1>
<p> <img src=SI10.jpg>
Parkroyal is a luxury hotel located in the Central Area of Singapore. The building's "hotel-in-a-garden" design has been lauded for its unique architecture that incorporates 15,000 m2 (160,000 sq ft) of elevated terraced gardens. It was opened in 2013. The hotel was designed by WOHA, a Singapore-based architecture firm known for incorporating extensive greenery in their buildings. Designed to be a "hotel-in-a-garden", Parkroyal on Pickering features extensive greenery, including green walls, water features and 15,000 square meters of tiered "sky gardens". The hotel's sky gardens are designed to be self-sustaining and consume minimal energy through the usage of solar cells, motion sensors, rainwater harvesting and reclaimed water. Parkroyal on Pickering has 367 rooms and suits. The fifth floor of the hotel is a dedicated wellness floor that features a day spa, fitness centre, infinity pool and garden. The hotel offers a restaurant and bar called LIME.
