Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore is a five-star deluxe hotel located on Orange Grove Road, Orchard Road, Singapore. Opened on 23 April 1971, the hotel is the flagship and the first hotel of Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts. The hotel has 747 guestrooms and suites spread over the Tower Wing, Garden Wing and Valley Wing, 127 serviced apartments, and 55 condominium units. The hotel is the annual host of a meeting of defence ministers, permanent heads of ministries, and military chiefs of 28 Asia-Pacific states since 2002 that has become known as the Shangri-La Dialogue. On 7 November 2015, the hotel served as the venue of a historic meeting between the People's Republic of China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and the Republic of China's President Ma Ying-jeou, the first meeting between a Mainland China's and Taiwan's leader since the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution. Opened in 1971, Tower Wing is the main wing of the hotel and houses the deluxe rooms, executive rooms, Horizon Club rooms, and Horizon Premier Suite. Besides the rooms and suites, majority of the dining outlets in the hotel are located at the Tower Wing.
