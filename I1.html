		Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres south of the 
		national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh. Agra is a major tourist destination. The 
		famous visiting place in Agra is Taj Mahal,a mausoleum builtfor the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan's wife, Mumtaz Mahal(who died
		in 1631). The imposing main building features a massive dome and carved white marble inlaid with precious stones. This is
		set behind a reflecting pool inside a courtyard defined by 4 minarets. Agra is one of the most significant cities in the history 
		of India(mostly during the mughal period). It remained the capital city even during the reign of Akbar,Jehangir, Shah Jahan 
		and Aurangzeb. It was during the Mughal Period when Agra gained some of the incredible monuments like the Taj Mahal, 
		Buland Darwaza and the Agra Fort.
